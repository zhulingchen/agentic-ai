research_task:
  description: >
    Conduct comprehensive research on {topic}, focusing on one specific subtopic that represents
    the most significant recent development or emerging trend.

    CRITICAL: You must limit your searches to AT MOST 4 internet searches total. Plan your
    searches carefully to maximize information gathering efficiency.

    Search strategies (use ONLY 3-4 searches):
    - First search: Broad overview of the topic to identify the most significant development
    - Second search: Specific technical implementation details or case studies
    - Third search: Research papers, academic articles, or hands-on guides/tutorials
    - Fourth search (only if you have fewer than 3 GitHub repositories or fewer than 3 quantitative data points after the first three searches): Related projects or tools

    Your research must:
    - Identify the most impactful recent advancement (within the last 3-6 months)
    - Analyze technical implementations with concrete examples
    - Locate 3-5 notable GitHub repositories with detailed descriptions
    - Include quantitative data (adoption rates, performance metrics, benchmarks)
    - Provide sources with URLs for every claim
    - Current date: {current_date}
    
    CRITICAL: Focus on depth over breadth. One topic explored thoroughly is better than 
    three topics covered superficially.
    
  expected_output: >
    A deeply researched analysis (800-1200 words) covering ONE specific subtopic in {topic}.
    
    Your output MUST include:
    1. Executive summary (2-3 sentences) explaining why this topic matters now
    2. Technical deep-dive with specific implementation details, not just concepts
    3. Real-world applications with named companies/projects and measurable outcomes
    4. Code snippets or architectural approaches described in detail
    5. For each GitHub repository (3-5 total): name, stars, what problem it solves, and what makes its approach unique
    6. Future implications supported by expert opinions or research papers
    7. All claims cited with source URLs
    
    Quality standards - your research should include:
    - At least 5 specific examples with company/project names
    - At least 3 quantitative data points (percentages, metrics, benchmark scores)
    - Minimum 5 distinct sources with URLs
    - Focus on developments from the last 3-6 months

reporting_task:
  description: >
    Transform the research into an engaging, educational report that balances technical depth
    with readability. Write in prose paragraphs with narrative flow - NO bullet points except
    in the Key Takeaways and Sources sections.
    
    Your approach:
    - Open with a compelling hook that explains immediate relevance
    - Expand each research point into fully developed paragraphs (4-8 sentences each) with smooth transitions
    - Include concrete examples: "For instance, Company X achieved Y by doing Z"
    - Add context: explain WHY something matters, not just WHAT it is
    - Use analogies or comparisons to clarify complex ideas
    - End with actionable insights
    
    CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:
    - Write in paragraphs, NOT bullet points (except for Key Takeaways and Sources)
    - Each main section must contain 3-6 full paragraphs
    - Minimum word count: 1200 words
    - Include at least 5 concrete examples with specific details (names, metrics, dates)
    - Explain all technical terms on first use
    
  expected_output: >
    Write and save a publication-quality report (1200-1800 words) formatted as markdown without code fences (```) to the output file.
    
    Required structure of the report:
    
    # [Compelling Title That Captures the Main Insight]
    
    ## Executive Summary
    [2-3 sentences capturing the key finding and its significance]
    
    ## Introduction
    [2-3 paragraphs setting context and explaining why this matters now. Include a specific
    statistic or recent event that demonstrates relevance.]
    
    ## Deep Dive: [Specific Topic]
    [4-6 paragraphs exploring the topic in depth. Each paragraph should:
    - Start with a clear topic sentence
    - Include at least one concrete example with specifics (company names, metrics, dates)
    - Explain technical concepts in accessible language
    - Connect to broader trends or implications
    - Flow naturally to the next paragraph]
    
    ## Real-World Applications
    [3-4 paragraphs with detailed case studies. Format each as:
    "At [Company/Project], engineers implemented [specific approach] to solve [specific problem].
    The result was [quantifiable outcome]. This demonstrates [insight]."]
    
    ## Notable Projects & Tools
    [For each of 3-5 projects, write a full paragraph (not bullets) covering:
    - Project name and GitHub link
    - The specific problem it addresses  
    - What makes its approach unique or innovative
    - Adoption metrics or community response
    - A technical detail that showcases its design philosophy]
    
    ## Future Outlook
    [2-3 paragraphs discussing:
    - Emerging trends building on this development
    - Potential challenges or limitations
    - Expert predictions with sources]
    
    ## Key Takeaways
    [NOW you can use bullets: 3-5 specific, actionable insights]
    
    ## Sources
    [Numbered list of all sources with full URLs]
    
    Before completing, verify your report includes:
    ✓ At least 5 concrete examples with company/project names
    ✓ At least 5 quantitative data points
    ✓ No paragraph shorter than 3 sentences in main sections
    ✓ Every claim is sourced
    ✓ Technical terms are explained
    ✓ Logical narrative flow throughout
